# Introduction

## Preface
Hello everyone, I'm [Nghia Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nghia-pham-70a0ab205/), you can call me Ben. I'm the creator of this website.

A few years ago, I started my software engineering career as an outsider to the tech industry. My background was in law so
I had no formal education in computer science at university. Instead, I joined a 2-year programming bootcamp at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and kept learning and practicing every day to become a software engineer.

I was aware that I need to make more efforts to supplement my lack of formal education compared to engineers who graduated from universities, so I keep learning new knowledge and technologies every day.
However, for a long time, I seldom noted down what I learned because it was not necessary and I thought I could remember it all. But as time passed, I found that I forgot many things that I had learned before.
Until one day I relized that the best way to learn is to teach. When you teach, you need to understand the knowledge deeply and clearly to explain it to others. Additionally, you can help others learn and grow, which is a great thing to do for the community.

That is the reason why I created this website to share my knowledge and experience with the community, especially those who are new to the tech industry or want to learn AWS.

I hope this website can help you learn AWS and other technologies effectively.

## Inspiration
[AWS Studying Group](https://awsstudygroup.com/) is a community of AWS enthusiasts who are passionate about learning and sharing knowledge about AWS.
I would like to thank [Mr. Hung Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jotaguy/) and the administrators of the group for inspiring me in developing my AWS skills and sharing knowledge with the community.
