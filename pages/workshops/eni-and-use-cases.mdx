# Elastic Network Interface (ENI) and Use Cases

## What is Elastic Network Interface (ENI)?

> An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. You can create and configure network interfaces and attach them to instances that you launch in the same Availability Zone. - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html)

Have you seen a network interface before? If you have ever set up a computer, you might have seen a **Network Interface Card (NIC)** that you plug into your computer to connect to the internet and other devices.

In AWS, **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** are the virtual equivalent of physical network interfaces.
You can think of an **ENI** as a virtual network card that you can attach to an **EC2 instance**, a little like how you would attach a physical network card to a computer. **ENIs** are used for connecting your instances to the internet, other instances, and other AWS services.

An **ENI** has the following attributes:
- A **primary private IPv4** address and one or more **secondary private IPv4 addresses**
- One **Elastic IP address** per **private IPv4 address**
- One **public IPv4 address**
- One or more **IPv6 addresses**
- One or more **security groups**
- A **MAC address**

Since **ENIs** are separate from instances, they can be managed independently and have their own lifecycle.
You can attach and detach **ENIs** from instances as needed. This allows you to move an **ENI** between instances, which can be useful for scenarios and use cases where you need to change the network configuration of an instance.

## Use Cases

From the attributes above, we can see that **ENIs** are versatile and can be used in various scenarios.
In this workshop, we will explore some use cases for **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** applied to real-world scenarios and step-by-step guides on how to set them up through hands-on labs.
