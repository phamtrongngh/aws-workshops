# Create an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

## Why do we need an additional ENI?
There are 2 things we must ensure when the **NAT instance** crashes or is terminated (accidentally or intentionally):
1. **The NAT instance must be replaced automatically by another one.** This will be achieved by setting up an **Auto-Scaling Group** in the next step.
2. **The private route tables still point correctly to the new NAT instance.** 
To achieve this requirement, one of the easiest ways is to create an **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**. 
This **ENI** will be attached to the **NAT instance** when it launches and all traffic to the internet from the **private instances** will go through this **ENI**. 
If the **NAT instance** crashes or is terminated, the **ENI** will be detached from the old instance and attached to the new instance automatically.
Therefore, the **private instances** will not be affected by the change.

## Create the ENI
1. Open the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. In the sidebar, choose **Network Interfaces**.
3. Choose **Create network interface**.
4. In the **Create network interface** wizard, enter the following information:
    - **Subnet**: Choose a public subnet you created earlier where the **NAT instance** will be launched.
    - **Private IP address**: Leave it `Auto-assign`.
    - **Security groups**: Choose the **security group** you created earlier for the **NAT instance**.

    - **Tags**: Add a tag with the key `Name` and value `nat-eni`. This tag will be used to identify the **ENI** later. So make sure to use the same key and value.

5. Choose **Create network interface**.


In many real-world cases, keeping the **NAT instance's** public IP address static is important. 
For example, if you integrate with a third-party service that requires a fixed IP address, you can use an **Elastic IP address (EIP)** and associate it with the **ENI**.
However, for this lab, we will not implement this feature to keep the workshop simple and cost-effective.
