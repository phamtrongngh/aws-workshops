# Create the Security Group for Private Instances

In this section, we will create a **security group** for the **private instances**. This **security group** allows inbound traffic from local network and outbound traffic to everywhere.

1. In the **VPC console**, choose **Security Groups** in the sidebar.
2. Choose **Create security group**.
3. Enter **Security group name**, **Description** and select the **VPC** you created in the previous step.

4. Add one inbound rule with the following settings:
    - **Type**: `All traffic`.
    - **Source**: `10.0.0.0/16`.

5. Add one outbound rule with the following settings:
    - **Type**: `All traffic`.
    - **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0` (everywhere).

    > Note: For simplicity, we allow all traffic in local network to the private instances. In a production environment, you should restrict it to only the necessary ports and sources.

6. Choose **Create security group**.
