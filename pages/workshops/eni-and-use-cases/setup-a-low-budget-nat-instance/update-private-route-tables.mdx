# Update Private Route Tables

We have two **route tables**, one for each **private subnet**. For now, these **route tables** just have a local route.

We need to add them another route that points to the **ENI** that will be attached to the **NAT instance**.

1. Open the [VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).
2. In the sidebar, choose **Route Tables**.
3. Select the **route table** associated with the first **private subnet**.
4. Choose the **Routes** tab and then **Edit routes**.
5. Choose **Add route**.
6. In the **Destination** field, enter `0.0.0.0/0`.
7. In the **Target** field, choose **Network Interface** and select the **Network Interface ID** we created in the previous step.
8. Choose **Save changes**.

Repeat the same steps for the **route table** associated with the second **private subnet**.
