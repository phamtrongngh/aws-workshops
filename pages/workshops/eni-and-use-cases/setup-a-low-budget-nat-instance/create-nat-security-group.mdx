# Create the Security Group for the NAT Instance

We need to create a **security group** for the **NAT instance**. This **security group** allows inbound traffic from the **private instances** and outbound traffic to everywhere.
We also allow SSH access to the NAT instance for testing purposes.

1. In the **VPC console**, choose **Security Groups** in the sidebar.
2. Choose **Create security group**.
3. Enter **Security group name**, **Description** and select the **VPC** you created in the previous step.

4. Add the following **inbound rules**:
    - **The first rule**:
        - **Type**: `All traffic`. 
        - **Source**: Select the **private security group** you created in the previous step.
    
    - **The second rule**:
        - **Type**: `SSH`. 
        - **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (everywhere). Or you can specify your IP address for security reasons.

        > Note: The second inbound rule allows SSH access to the NAT instance from anywhere for testing purposes. You can restrict it to your IP address for security reasons.

5. Add this **outbound rule**:
    - **Type**: `All traffic`.
    - **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0` (everywhere).
