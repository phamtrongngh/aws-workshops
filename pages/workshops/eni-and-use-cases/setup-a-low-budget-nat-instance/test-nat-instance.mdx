# Test the NAT instance

## Create an EC2 Instance in the Private Subnet

Now that you have set up the **NAT instance**, we can test it by launching an **EC2 instance** in the **private subnet** and verifying that it can access the internet through the **NAT instance**.

1. Open the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. In the sidebar, choose **Instances**.
3. Choose **Launch instances**.
4. In the **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**, choose **Quick Start** and **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**.

5. Choose `t2.micro` as the **Instance type** which is eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
6. Choose **Key pair** for SSH access to the instance. We should use the same key pair as the **NAT instance** for **SSH agent forwarding** in the next step.

7. In the **Network settings**, select the **VPC** we created earlier and choose one of the **private subnets**. Then choose the **security group** you created earlier for the **private instance**.

8. Choose **Launch instance**.

## SSH Agent Forwarding to NAT Instance

To test the **NAT instance**, we need to SSH into the **private instance** through the **NAT instance**. 
Instead of copying the private key to the **NAT instance**, which is not recommended for security reasons, we will use **SSH agent forwarding**.

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to enable SSH agent forwarding:
    ```bash copy
    ssh-add -K /path/to/your/private-key.pem
    ssh -A ec2-user@<NAT-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/private-key.pem` with the path to your private key and `<NAT-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>` with the **public IP address** of the **NAT instance** which you can find in the **EC2 console**.
    
    In my case, the key is located at `~/.ssh/benlab.pem` and the **public IP address** of the **NAT instance** is `18.209.95.90`. So, the command will be:
    ```bash copy
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/benlab.pem
    ssh -A ec2-user@18.209.95.90
    ```

3. Once you are connected to the **NAT instance**, you can SSH into the **private instance** using the **private IP address**:
    ```bash copy
    ssh ec2-user@<PRIVATE-INSTANCE-PRIVATE-IP>
    ```
    Replace `<PRIVATE-INSTANCE-PRIVATE-IP>` with the **private IP address** of the **private instance** which you can find in the **EC2 console**.
    In my case, the private IP address of the **private instance** is `10.0.157.135`. So, the command will be:
    ```bash copy
    ssh ec2-user@10.0.157.135
    ```

4. You should now be connected to the **private instance** through the **NAT instance**.

## Test Internet Connectivity

Now that you are connected to the **private instance**, we will run some commands to test the internet connectivity.

1. Ping to **google.com**:
    ```bash copy
    ping -c 4 google.com
    ```
    You should see the ping responses from **google.com**.

2. Get the public IP address:
    ```bash copy
    curl ipv4.icanhazip.com
    ```
    You should see the **public IP address** of the **NAT instance**. This confirms that the **private instance** is using the **NAT instance** to access the internet.

## Test the NAT Instance Recovery

Since the **NAT instance** is launched in the **Auto-Scaling Group**, it will be automatically recovered if the instance is terminated (intentionally or unintentionally).
We will test this by terminating the **NAT instance** and verifying that a new **NAT instance** is launched in its place.

#### Terminate the NAT Instance
1. Open the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. In the sidebar, choose **Instances**.
3. Select the **NAT instance**.
4. Choose **Instance State > Terminate instance**.
5. Choose **Terminate** in the confirmation dialog.

#### Verify the Recovery
Now you can see that the **NAT instance** is terminated. And after a few minutes, a new **NAT instance** will be launched and configured automatically. 
You can verify this by checking the **EC2 console**.

You can SSH into the **private instance** again and test the internet connectivity, as we did earlier. It should work without any issues.
