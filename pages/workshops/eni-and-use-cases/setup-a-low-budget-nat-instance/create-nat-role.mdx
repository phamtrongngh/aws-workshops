# Create IAM Role for the NAT Instance

The **NAT instance** will have to perform the following actions in its launch process:
- Disable the **Source/destination check**, which is enabled by default for **EC2 instances**. If not, the **NAT instance** will drop the traffic that is not coming from or going to itself.
- Attach the **ENI**. The **NAT instance** will use this **ENI** to forward traffic from the private instances to the internet and vice versa.

Therefore, we need to create an **IAM role** and attach it to the **NAT instance** later. This **IAM role** allows the **NAT instance** to perform the actions mentioned above.

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
2. In the sidebar, choose **Roles**.
3. Choose **Create role**.
4. Choose `AWS service` as the **Trusted entity type** and select `EC2` as the **Use case**. Choose **Next**.

5. In the **Add permissions** page, search for and select `AmazonEC2FullAccess`. And then choose **Next**.

    Note that the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy is used here for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should create a custom policy with the minimum required permissions.
    For example, you can create a custom policy with the following permissions:
        ```json copy
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute",
                        "ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

6. In the **Review** page, enter the **Role name** and choose **Create role**.
