# Prerequisites
Labs in this repository assume that you have an AWS account and basic knowledge of AWS services. It's designed for those who want to practice and hands-on with AWS services.

# Notes
- Labs in this repository might use AWS resources that are not covered under the AWS Free Tier. Please check the pricing of the services before starting the lab.
- Make sure to clean up the resources after completing the lab to avoid any unexpected charges.
- Most of the labs interact with AWS services using the AWS CLI for simplicity and consistency. You can use the AWS Management Console if you prefer.
